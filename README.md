This repository acts as a fallback for all of my repositories that don't have an actual `.github` directory with issue/pull request templates, code of conduct and other community health files,...

## Development

Pretty straight forward since this is just a fall back `.github` folder.
No sophistacted tech needed, just add or modify anything... as your liking and suits your personal repositories.
